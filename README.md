# lunchbot
A slackbot used to give recommendations for lunch spots and happy hours.

# What it uses (not an exclusive list)
- nodejs to run the bot
- maybe some python for the backend stuff
- maybe some mongo for the database stuff
- probably javascript for the top-level/user-interaction stuff
- Botkit to make our lives easier https://howdy.ai/botkit/

# To Start It
token=REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN node slack_bot.js

I have no idea what happens when multiple users try to start up the same bot. Let's try to avoid that.
